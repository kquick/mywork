The mywork tool is a TUI tool that maintains a list of projects, the various
locations for those projects, and notes associated with each location.  This is
designed to help keep track of what you have been working on, the relationships
of the various locations for a project, and to maintain context for that work
(assisting a future resumption of work) via the notes.
